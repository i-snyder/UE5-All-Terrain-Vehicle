# UE5-All-Terrain-Vehicle

I'm currently coding a physics-based vehicle game using C++ and UE5. I'm working towards an integration of the [Jolt physics engine](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics) in UE5 as an alternative to the new Chaos physics system. Jolt can be more performant than Chaos and PhysX, and some devs have not been happy with the switch to Chaos, so I'm interested in seeing if there are significant differences between Chaos and Jolt in a real project.
